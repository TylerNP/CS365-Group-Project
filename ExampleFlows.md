John Smith just watched a new movie in the theatres. He really enjoyed this movie and would like to see similar movies. He goes on (our project) and searches for the movie he just watched. He adds it to his list of liked movies and rates it from 1-10. John then requests to see movies like the one he just likes and rated.

John starts by loggin into or signing up for an account 
He calls SEARCH and inputs the movie he just watched.
He calls ADD to his liked movie list with his rating.
He decides he would like to see which movies are similar to the movie he just watched so he calls RECOMMEND
