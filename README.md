## Description

This Project will create a movie watchlist platform where users can add movies they want to watch later. The platform provides metrics on the added movies such as the title, director, year of release, genre, and user ratings etc. With this, users would be able to create accounts that allow them to save movies they watched, create comments, rate movies, and receive personalized recommendations for different movies to watch based off their history.
